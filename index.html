            <p class="resume inactive">My name is Emerson. I'm 19 years old and I'm natural from Tietê, a small
                city on the state of São Paulo, Brazil. I've lived my whole live on the contryside but currently I am
                living in the capital, where I am studying at the University of São Paulo. I'm majoring in Social
                Sciences. It's a very insteresting field that comprehends Sociology, Anthropology and Political Science.
                I'm really keen on technology but what I really really like to study and talk about is the subjects that
                deal with social problems, politics, etc. so when I learned about this major, it really seemed like the
                perfect fit for me.

                <p class="about-art inactive">When I was younger I really didn't care about art, but as I grew I
                    started to really apreciate art as a whole, specially paintings and architecture. Regarding
                    paintings, my favorite movement is the European Expresionism, whereas in achitecture, the gothic
                    style is what I find the most pleasing. Here are some of my favorite paintings:

        <h1 class="poliglot inactive">I'm a poliglot!</h1>
        <p class="about-poliglot inactive">At first, I thought I would only learn English, but I fell in love
            with the language learning process and the new experiencies that knowing a foreign language can provide to
            you. So, while I learned English in a language school, I started to learn French by myself in High School.
            Then I went on to Spanish and currently I am studying German and Italian. Learning a new language can be
            quite stressful but it really pays off in the end.

        <h1 class="chess inactive">I was a semi-professional chess player.</h1>
        <p class="about-chess inactive">I started playing when I was 12 years old when got relly into the game. I
            continued playing with my own coach and got pretty far, I even managed to get a master title (National
            Master!). When I got to high-school I stopped competing because I was a bit burned out. Nowadays I still
            play but more casually. Here's my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/emersonlima">Chess.com profile.</a>

        <div class="div-reading div-reading-inactive">
            <p class="about-reading inactive">I started off reading juvenile fiction. The first series that I became a
                fan of was "Diary of a Wimpy Kid". I have all the books and have read them several times. Then I had a
                Greek Mithology phase and obviously I read the Percy Jackson books and some others in the same theme
                from diferent authors. Nowadays, I still read fiction, but I also try reading some of the classics from
                Brazilian literature (as well as other contries) and more academic works from my area of study.</p>

        <h1 class="finally inactive">And finally...</h1>

        <h1 class="coding inactive">I like coding!</h1>
        <p class="about-coding inactive">I started learning about web-development when I was in high-school. I went to a
            school that taught us about it and found it pretty cool. I ended up moving to a different school for my last
            year of school but I still wanted to learn about it so I decided to study it by myself. And here am I haha.
            Right now, I am focusing on web development and I'm hoping to get a job on the area, but in the future I
            want to learn some other languages such as Java, C# and C++. I have done several projects, but the one I'm
            most proud of is my <a href="https://github.com/poissonfou/Carousel_Albums">Albums Carousel</a>, since it is
            my own design, and I think I did a pretty good job :).
