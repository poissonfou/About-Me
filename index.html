        <p class="resume">My name is Emerson. I'm 19 years old and I'm natural from Tietê, a small city on the state of
            São Paulo, Brazil. I've lived my whole live on the contryside but currently I am living in the capital,
            where I am studying at the University of São Paulo. I'm majoring in Social Sciences. It's a veryinsteresting
            field that comprehends Sociology, Anthropology and Political Science. I'm really keen on technology but what
            I really really like to study and talk about is the subjects that deal with social problems, politics, etc.
            so when I learned about this major, it really seemed like the perfect fit for me.

            <h1>I'm really into art.</h1>
            <p class="about-art">when I was younger I really didn't care about art, but as I grew I started to really
                apreciate art as a whole, specially paintings and architecture. Regarding paintings, my favorite
                movement is the European Expresionism, whereas in achitecture, the gothic style is what I find the most
                pleasing. Here are some of my favorite paintings:

    <p class="about-poliglot">At first, I thought I would only learn English, but I fell in love with the language
        learning process and the new experiencies that knowing a foreign language can provide to you. So, while I
        learned English in a language school, I started to learn French by myself in High School. Then I went on to
        Spanish and currently I am studying German and Italian. Learning a new language can be quite stressful but it
        really pays off in the end.
